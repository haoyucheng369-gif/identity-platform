# AuthFlowLab

A minimal authentication and authorization lab for learning JWT bearer validation and OAuth2-style flows.

## Current Scope

- User login issues JWT access tokens.
- Client credentials uses the OAuth2-style `/connect/token` endpoint.
- Authorization code + PKCE issues user access tokens through `/connect/authorize` and `/connect/token`.
- Auth Server exposes OpenID Connect discovery metadata and JWKS.
- API Server validates JWTs signed by Auth Server.
- API endpoints demonstrate anonymous, authenticated, role, scope, service-only, and API-key authorization.

## Architecture

Frontend -> Auth Server -> API -> Database

For the current lab stage:

- Auth Server signs JWTs with `keys/private.key`.
- Auth Server exposes its public signing key through JWKS.
- API Server uses `Jwt:Authority` to load discovery metadata and JWKS automatically.
- User accounts, client credentials, allowed scopes, and token lifetime are configured in `AuthFlowLab.AuthServer/appsettings.json`.

## Run Locally

From the repository root:

```powershell
dotnet run --project backend\AuthFlowLab.AuthServer\AuthFlowLab.AuthServer.csproj --urls http://127.0.0.1:5001
dotnet run --project backend\AuthFlowLab.ApiServer\AuthFlowLab.ApiServer.csproj --urls http://127.0.0.1:5002
```

## Test Users And Clients

Users:

| Username | Password | Role  | Scope        |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `user` | `user123` | `User` | `content.read` |
| `admin` | `admin123` | `Admin` | `content.read content.write` |

Client:

| Client ID | Client Secret | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `worker-service` | `worker-secret` | `content.read content.write` |
| `demo-spa` | none | `openid profile content.read` |

These are lab credentials. Do not use committed secrets for real systems.

API key:

| Name | Header | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `internal-tool` | `X-Api-Key` | `dev-api-key-123` |

The API key is a lab credential configured on the API Server. It is not an OAuth2/OIDC grant type.

## Auth Server API

### Login

```http
POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "user",
  "password": "user123"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "access_token": "<jwt>",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 1800,
  "scope": "content.read"
}
```

Invalid credentials return:

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_grant",
  "error_description": "The username or password is invalid."
}
```

### Client Credentials Token

```http
POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/connect/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials
&client_id=worker-service
&client_secret=worker-secret
&scope=content.read content.write
```

The response shape is the same as login. Invalid clients return `invalid_client`; unsupported grant types return `unsupported_grant_type`; disallowed scopes return `invalid_scope`.

The old lab-only `/auth/client-token` endpoint has been removed. Service tokens now use the OAuth2-style `/connect/token` endpoint.

### Authorization Code + PKCE And OIDC

The current lab version simulates the login page by accepting `username` and `password` on the authorize request. A real frontend will replace that with a browser login screen.

When the request includes `openid`, Auth Server also returns an OIDC `id_token`. The `access_token` is for API access; the `id_token` is for the client application to know who logged in.

Start the authorization request:

```http
GET http://127.0.0.1:5001/connect/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=demo-spa&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A5173%2Fcallback&scope=openid%20profile%20content.read&state=demo-state&nonce=demo-nonce&code_challenge=mvtzfCbIJ5YDPp1UVYfCnz2ZSvRrCEUgWtyrhVS6xo8&code_challenge_method=S256&username=user&password=user123
```

For this example:

```text
code_verifier = demo-code-verifier-1234567890
code_challenge = mvtzfCbIJ5YDPp1UVYfCnz2ZSvRrCEUgWtyrhVS6xo8
nonce = demo-nonce
```

The response redirects to the registered callback URL with `code` and `state`:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173/callback?code=<authorization-code>&state=demo-state
```

Exchange the code for a user access token:
Because the original scope included `openid`, the response also includes `id_token`.

```http
POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/connect/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code
&client_id=demo-spa
&code=<authorization-code>
&redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:5173/callback
&code_verifier=demo-code-verifier-1234567890
```

Call UserInfo with the returned access token:

```http
GET http://127.0.0.1:5001/connect/userinfo
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
```

### Discovery And JWKS

```http
GET http://127.0.0.1:5001/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

The discovery document includes the issuer, token endpoint, JWKS URI, supported grant types, and supported scopes.

```http
GET http://127.0.0.1:5001/.well-known/jwks.json
```

The JWKS document exposes the RSA public key used by API servers to verify JWT signatures.

## API Server Endpoints

| Endpoint | Authorization |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /content/public` | Anonymous |
| `GET /content/user` | Any valid bearer token |
| `GET /content/admin` | `Admin` role |
| `GET /content/read` | `content.read` scope |
| `POST /content/write` | `content.write` scope |
| `GET /content/service` | `token_type=service` |
| `GET /content/api-key` | Valid `X-Api-Key` header |

Example:

```http
GET http://127.0.0.1:5002/content/read
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

API key example:

```http
GET http://127.0.0.1:5002/content/api-key
X-Api-Key: dev-api-key-123
```

## HTTP Examples

Use these files with Visual Studio, Rider, or the REST Client extension:

- `backend/AuthFlowLab.http` contains the full Auth Server + API Server flow.
- `backend/AuthFlowLab.AuthServer/AuthFlowLab.AuthServer.http` contains Auth Server requests.
- `backend/AuthFlowLab.ApiServer/AuthFlowLab.ApiServer.http` contains API Server requests.

Keep shared `.http` files token-free. If you want to store personal tokens locally, create a file such as `backend/AuthFlowLab.local.http`; `*.local.http` is ignored by Git.

## Tests

```powershell
dotnet test backend\AuthFlowLab.sln
```
